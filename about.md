CESTA labs pursue research which utilize data and information visualization that span a variety of methodologies, disciplines, and departments, often collaborating with diverse team members from within the Stanford community, but also externally through national and international collaborations. Please see the individual lab links on the main CESTA page to find more information and details about each labâ€™s members and projects.</p>

CESTA is located on the fourth floor of Wallenberg Hall (Building 160), on the Stanford Campus.
