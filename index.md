The Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis (CESTA) is comprised of the Spatial History Project, Humanities + Design, and the Literary Lab. This interdisciplinary collective of labs operates independently of any one particular home department, and is organizationally housed within the Dean of Research at Stanford University.

CESTA labs pursue research which utilize data and information visualization that span a variety of methodologies, disciplines, and departments, often collaborating with diverse team members from within the Stanford community, but also externally through national and international collaborations. Please see the individual lab links on the main CESTA page to find more information and details about each labâ€™s members and projects.
