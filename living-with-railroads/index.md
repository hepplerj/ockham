Following the work of Richard White, Living with the Railroads seeks to use crowdsourcing to learn more about the social, cultural, and environmental impact of the development and expansion of the railroads in the American West, and hopefully eventually across the United States.  The crowd in trains is neither the more amorphous crowd of 500 Novels, or the crowd of those generally interested in the San Francisco Bay Area of Year of the Bay; rather, the crowd we seek to engage in Living with the Railroads is that of railroad enthusiasts.  This project, therefore, had to explore and lay the groundwork for interacting with this specialized crowd in a different manner than either of the other two projects. The goal, in conjunction with Historypin, is to get railroad enthusiasts to upload their data, identify images and documents whose provenance is unknown, and help facilitate the growth of connections between enthusiast and enthusiast communities, thus providing a useful tool to the enthusiast community.  That is, this project is not just seeking data from people, but hopes to get people to see the Historypin Railroads site, and partnership with Stanford, as something to their benefit and enjoyment.
