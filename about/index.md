This project, funded by a grant from the Mellon Foundation, seeks to test ways in which humanities researchers might use different types of crowdsourcing and communitysourcing to further research, and ask questions that would be difficult or impossible to do in more traditional modes of inquiry.  Crowdsourcing, or communitysourcing (different terms for what is broadly the same thing) is, at its most basic, a mode of research, knowledge gathering, and analysis, whereby a researcher engages a community to provide answers to questions or solutions to problems or analysis of material.  There are many different forms of crowdsourcing, but they are all linked by the idea that a large group of people can offer solutions to research questions and data analysis that would be unavailable to the individual or small group

Because of the possibilities of wider engagement, crowdsourcing offers opportunities to advance humanistic work with and beyond the walls of the academy. We seek to identify and explore the best practices as well as pitfalls of a few crowdsourcing methods. To do so, we are conducting three simultaneous crowdsourcing projects: The Year of the Bay, Living with the Railroads, and 500 Novels.  Each project is engaged with different kinds of crowds, and is asking different questions.  And each, in different ways, is exploring the possibilities of partnering with non-academic media bodies.  In the case of Year of the Bay and Living with the Railroads, our partner is Historypin, “a global community collaborating around history”, which offers users a web based platform where memories (in the form of images and audio/visual materials) can be pinned to a map, locating the material in both time and space.  We are currently running a set of controlled experiments with each of the projects involving academic researchers and non-academic media bodies each defining a particular aspect of crowdsourcing and exploring how it might contribute to academic research, and, concomitantly, to community engagement.


### Historypin

Historypin is a way for millions of people to come together, from across different generations, cultures and places, to share small glimpses of the past and to build up the huge story of human history.

Everyone has history to share: whether its sitting in yellowed albums in the attic, collected in piles of crackly tapes, conserved in the 1000s of archives all over the world or passed down in memories and old stories.

Each of these pieces of history finds a home on Historypin, where everyone has the chance to see it, add to it, learn from it, debate it and use it to build up a more complete understanding of the world.

Historypin has been developed by the not-for-profit company We Are What We Do, in partnership with Google.

### Mellon Foundation

The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation currently makes grants in four core program areas: 

* Higher Education and Scholarship
* Scholarly Communications and Information Technology
* Art History, Conservation, and Museums
* Performing Arts

Within each of its core programs, the Foundation concentrates most of its grantmaking in a few areas. Institutions and programs receiving support are often leaders in fields of Foundation activity, but they may also be promising newcomers, or in a position to demonstrate new ways of overcoming obstacles to achieve program goals.

Our grantmaking philosophy is to build, strengthen and sustain institutions and their core capacities, rather than be a source for narrowly defined projects. As such, we develop thoughtful, long-term collaborations with grant recipients and invest sufficient funds for an extended period to accomplish the purpose at hand and achieve meaningful results.

Crowdsourcing for the Humanities received its grant under the Scholarly Communications and Information Technology program area.
