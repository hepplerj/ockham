# ockham

Ockham is a platform for publishing collaborative research in the humanities
built on top of [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).

Beginning with Jekyll, Twitter Bootstrap, and GitHub we are building a static 
site publishing platform for humanities research. The goal is to keep it simple. 
No CMS, no elaborate back-end administration, just content managed directly by 
the scholars who create it.   

By design, content and formatting are kept separate, while making the maintaining and 
updating information easy for individuals without knowledge of (or interest in)
HTML. We seek to make this happen by integrating Google Drive, Prose.io, and
Github Gists.
