# ockham

Ockham is a platform for publishing collaborative research in the humanities built on top of [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).

Beginning with Jekyll, Twitter Bootstrap, and GitHub we are building a static site publishing platform for humanities research. The goal is to keep it simple. No CMS, no elaborate back-end administration, just content managed directly by the scholars who create it.   

By design, content and formatting are kept separate, while making the maintaining and updating information easy for individuals without knowledge of (or interest in)HTML. We seek to make this happen by integrating cloud file shares and possily Gists.

## Layouts

Ockham includes layouts for the type of research project content we have identified as essential:

- People

- Funding
- Publications
