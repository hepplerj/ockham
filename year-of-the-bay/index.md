The Year of the Bay project was designed to test the experience of conducting crowdsourcing for the humanities at the confluence of major public events that could garner widespread attention and enlarge the audience for a crowdsourcing project. Events such as the America's Cup in San Francisco Bay, the completion of the new span of the historic San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, the 150th anniversary of the Port of San Francisco, the opening of a new home for the Exploratorium on the bay, and exhibitions at the California Historical Society and the Oakland Museum of California all demonstrate that 2013 was indeed a “Year of the Bay” to remember. Our goal is to collaborate with media organizations and museums, libraries, and archives to bring people to Historypin’s Year of the Bay project page to engage with archival materials by pinning snapshots of history through space, or location, and time from various sources including organizational, individual, and family archives. Our hope was twofold: 1) that participants would help generate useful, accurate, and meaningful metadata for archival sources lacking metadata, and 2) that new archival materials would diversify and enrich our understanding of the environmental history of the San Francisco Bay and different cultural understandings and practices related to the bay.
